                <h2 class="h2-youtubability">Youtubability</h2>

                <p class="paragraph-text1">A key driver of youtubability is the clarity
                    of your gameplay to a potential player.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-text1"> Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the
                    full potential of your game by working on
                    getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your
                    games.</p>


                <p class="paragraph-text1">Many elements can be used to make your
                    game clearer:</p>

                <p class="paragraph-text1">For instance, ask yourself if a user’s interaction
                    with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for
                    example, can she tell which character she
                    <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it
                    look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the
                    game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
                    seconds (too long!).</p>


                <p class="paragraph-text1">Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate
                    the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
                    Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in
                    orange here) and instantly recognized as
                    a threat.</p>

                    If you want to run user tests with
                    friends and family or even random
                    people in the street, it is interesting to
                    show them the 30 second video before
                    making them try to prototype in order to<strong>
                    understand their</strong> expectations from
                    the video vs. the actual game they try.

                <p class="paragraph-text2 p2">

                    <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements
                    that help <strong>understand the objective and
                        controls</strong> of the game, like with the
                    target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s
                    Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw
                    Car with the space dedicated to
                    drawing.

                People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong> on their
                phone’s Facebook feed,</strong> everything will seem smaller than when
                displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong> You should
                also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if
                someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3
                to 5 seconds, this is an <strong> accelerated elevator pitch!</strong> 
                <br><br>
                Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on
                YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea
                for your game videos.
